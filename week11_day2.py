print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Manuel"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Purple"
favorite_number = 4

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())


# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name),"Letters")

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message

print(f"{first_name} and {favorite_color}")
#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
print(favorite_number *5)
favnumber= int(input("what is your favorite number"))
print(favnumber)
num1= int(input("what is your favorite first number"))
num2= int(input("What is your second favorite number?"))
print(num1+num2)
#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
